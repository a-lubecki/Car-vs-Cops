# Car-vs-Cops-2020

Car vs Cops is a hyper-casual game prototype I made for a job interview. The goal is to escape cops with your car. The more they're close to you, the more you increase your score but if they touch you 3 times, it's game over. Also, there are barrels of gasoline on the map to help you destroy the other cars.
